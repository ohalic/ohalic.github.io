<center><h1>Timeliness</h1></center>

**Definition by [ESTUARY](https://estuary.dev/data-quality/)**

- The timeliness of data ensures it is readily available and up-to-date when needed. It is a user expectation; if your data isn't prepared exactly when required, it falls short of meeting the timeliness dimension. 

Timeliness is about reducing latency and ensuring that the correct data reaches the right people at the right time. A general rule of thumb here is that the fresher the data, the more likely it is to be accurate.
